# node-ts-starter

A simple starter template for working with TypeScript and Node.js.
This is not intended to be robust, nor universally suitable for all
TypeScript-Node.js projects. This repo can be cloned to allow one to
begin writing, building and running TypeScript for simple Node.js
scripts, with the ability to modify and extend as needed during
development.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this template, install dependencies, build the
project and run it with the following commands:

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

Begin writing code in `src/index.ts`. Rebuild before
running again to see your changes in action!
